  <p>Hello, my name is Karl. I like to write code. Sometimes I record things that Iâ€™ve discovered.</p>
  <p>My memory is bad. This blog helps me when my memory fails.</p>
  <p>The inspiration for the name of this blog comes from the book, <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>.</p>
  <p>You can find the code for this site in the <a href="https://github.com/kswedberg/blog.karlswedberg.com">Github repo</a>.</p>
  <p>You can contact me via email. Just combine the initial letter of my first name (<kbd>"k"</kbd>) with my entire last name ("<kbd>swedberg</kbd>") and append "<kbd>@gmail.com</kbd>" </p>
  <p>If you'd like to know more about me, head over to my <a href="https://karlswedberg.com/">profile site</a>. It has a <a href="https://karlswedberg.com/contact">contact form</a> you can use if you'd rather not stitch together my email address.</p>
