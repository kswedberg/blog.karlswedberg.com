Lately I've been dabbling with bash scripting, mostly setting up aliases and very simple functions to make my life on the command line a little easier and more efficient. A couple weeks ago I stumbled upon a bash-scripting gold mine called "bash-it." It's a [GitHub Repo][1] with lots of custom aliases, completions for Git, Rake, SSH, Homebrew, and others, command prompt themes, custom functions, and a bunch of other goodies. I already [forked it][2] and sent a pull request for my own command prompt theme.

If my 20-year-old self could see my 43-year-old self, he would be amazed by how incredibly geeky I've become.
