title: Disabling form controls
categories: html

> A form control is disabled if its disabled attribute is set, or if it is a descendant of a fieldset element whose disabled attribute is set and is not a descendant of that fieldset element's first legend element child, if any.

> A form control that is disabled must prevent any click events that are queued on the user interaction task source from being dispatched on the element.
