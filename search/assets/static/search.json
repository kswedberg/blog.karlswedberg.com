Some of the super-old-school blogs I followed (like 456 Berea Street) haven't seen new posts in 7+ years, so I pruned those. Others trickle in once or twice a year, which is totally fine by me, while a few are so prodigious in their output it makes me wonder how the people behind them find time for their paid work. I've been using a feed reader as my main source of web-development news and information for more than fifteen years. I can't remember what I started with, but NetNewsWire was my go-to app for a number of years until its developer neglected it and let it stagnate.

If you were especially masochistic, you used &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"&gt; with the application/xhtml+xml mime type. Standards compliance was all the rage, and webmasters loved to show that their sites passed the W3C markup validator. But such compliance meant that you couldn't have some nice things, like block-level elements inside a link (aka \"anchor\" element). For example, this was not valid: &lt;a href=\"https://example.com\"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;heading&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt;excerpt&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; With HTML 4.01, you could probably get away with it, though you might be shamed into removing your badge.

The site worked pretty well, too. It loaded quickly and looked about as okay as you'd expect of something built by a design-challenged developer like myself.
